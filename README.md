# BlogAndroidApp
Native Android app in Kotlin. BlogApp shows you the latest blog posts that users can read. Each post is precisely described. The layout follows the best margins, margins, and font text practices to make posts more readable. Additionally, users can write a message from the internal form to inform the admin about errors in the UI or backend, and even in the text of the post.


Posts are added from a dedicated website and from the appropriate form. The text, timestamps and graphics are stored in the Firebase No-SQL database and return from there to display on the screen of the mobile device.
